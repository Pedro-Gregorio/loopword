# LoopWord

LoopWord is a simple project I created to have fun with some logic concepts.

It is inspired on [The New York Times Wordle Game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), with a twist: you can play as many times as you want!

## To try LoopWord

Head over to [LoopWord's Website](https://loopword.app) to try it!

## To try locally

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project.

Firstly, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Secondly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Future Plans

I still have a couple of ideas to work on, both for fun and to challenge myself, on LoopWord, such as:

- Allow users to create accounts to store their top streaks
- Show users top Streaks in a Leaderboard
- Improve the visual aesthetics of the board itself, such as:
  - Animate letters when they're added;
  - Animate the input on validation;
  - Make the end of the game more fun;
  - Add a light more, surely;
